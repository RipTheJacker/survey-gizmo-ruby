#### WARNING:

This is version `2.0.0` of the gem, which introduces breaking changes. People who need backwards compatibility can use `1.0.4`.

What's fixed/better:
* Filtering of requests is implemented
* Requests for the questions in a survey now retrieve ALL of the questions, even the sneaky sub_questions that weren't directly returned to a basic API request.

What broke:
* SurveyGizmo objects (Survey, SurveyQuestion, etc) no longer track their own state (:new, :zombie, :saved, etc etc) - state tracking was useless anyways because exceptions always were raised on errors.
* There is no more SurveyGizmo::Collection class...  now there are just Arrays.
* There is no more lazy loading/instantiation.

What's different:
* Variables are not autoloaded.  That is to say when you load a Survey, the API request that loads the associated questions is not executed until you ask for them with the #questions method

Also a past warning from another author:
> SurveyGizmo doesn't test their REST API when they roll out changes.  They don't publish a list of active defects, and when you call/email for support it is unlikely you will geto a person that knows anything about programming or the REST API.  You can't talk to level 2 support, although they might offer you a discount on their paid consulting rates if the problem persists for more than a few weeks.

# Survey Gizmo (ruby)

Integrate with the [Survey Gizmo API](http://apisurveygizmo.helpgizmo.com/help) using an ActiveModel style interface. We currently support rest API **v3**. If you want to use version 1 of the API, please use gem version ~0.7.0

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'survey-gizmo-ruby'
```

## Basic Usage

```ruby
require 'survey-gizmo-ruby'

# somewhere in your app define your survey gizmo login credentials.
SurveyGizmo.setup(user: 'you@somewhere.com', password: 'mypassword')

# Retrieve the survey with id: 12345
survey = SurveyGizmo::API::Survey.first(id: 12345)
survey.title # => My Title
survey.pages # => [page1, page2,...]

# Create a question for your survey
question = SurveyGizmo::API::Question.create(survey_id: survey.id, title: 'Do you like ruby?', type: 'checkbox')
question.title = "Do you LOVE Ruby?"
question.save # => question # (but now with the id assigned by SurveyGizmo as the :id property)

  # Error handling
  question.save # => false
  question.errors # => ['There was an error']

# Retrieving Questions for a given survey.  Note that page_id is a required parameter.
questions = SurveyGizmo::API::Question.all(survey_id: survey.id, page_id: 1)
# Or just retrieve all questions for all pages of this survey
questions = survey.questions

# Retrieving SurveyResponses for a given survey.
# Note that because of both options being hashes, you need to enclose them both in braces to page successfully!
responses = SurveyGizmo::API::Response.all({survey_id: survey.id}, {page: 1})

# Retrieving page 2 of non test data SurveyResponses
filters  = {page: 2, filters: [{field: 'istestdata', operator: '<>', value: 1}] }
responses = SurveyGizmo::API::Response.all({survey_id: survey_id}, filters)
```

## Debugging

The GIZMO_DEBUG environment variable will trigger full printouts of SurveyGizmo's HTTP responses and variable introspection for almost everything

```bash
cd /my/app
export GIZMO_DEBUG=true
bundle exec rails whatever
```

## Adding API Objects

Currently, the following API objects are included in the gem: `Survey`, `Question`, `Option`, `Page`, `Response`, `EmailMessage`, `SurveyCampaign`, `Contact`, `AccountTeams`. If you want to use something that isn't included you can easily write a class that handles it. Here's an example of the how to do so:

```ruby
class SomeObject
  # the base where most of the methods for handling the API are stored
  include SurveyGizmo::Resource

  # the attributes the object should respond to
  attribute :id,          Integer
  attribute :title,       String
  attribute :status,      String
  attribute :type,        String
  attribute :created_on,  DateTime

  # defing the paths used to retrieve/set info
  route '/something/:id', :via => [:get, :update, :delete]
  route '/something',     :via => :create

  # this must be defined with the params that would be included in any route
  def to_param_options
    {:id => self.id}
  end
end
```

The [Virtus](https://github.com/solnic/virtus) gem is included to handle the attributes, so please check their documentation as well.

# Contributing to survey-gizmo-ruby

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Take a gander at the github issues beforehand
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch and hack away
* Make sure to add tests for it!!!!
* Submit a pull request
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

## Missing Features

* It would be nice to implement enumerable on the Question and (especially) Response objects so people don't have to implement their own paging
* There are several API objects that are available and not included in this gem.
* It is also missing OAuth authentication ability.
